# Configuration

## Precedence

1. **CLI flags**
2. **Environment**: provider secrets (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`), OpenRouter base URL, and TTS (`AURUM_TTS_*`)
3. **Config file**
4. **Built-in defaults**

A provider is **never** selected merely because its API key is present. Omitted STT/TTS `provider` remains `local`.

## Environment

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter auth (preferred over file `api_key`) |
| `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` | Override OpenRouter API base (tests / proxies) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI provider-scoped secret |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | ElevenLabs provider-scoped secret |
| `XAI_API_KEY` | xAI provider-scoped secret |
| `AURUM_TTS_MODEL` | Override `[tts].model` |
| `AURUM_TTS_VOICE` | Override `[tts].voice` |
| `AURUM_TTS_LANGUAGE` | Override `[tts].language` |
| `RUST_LOG` | Tracing filters |

Secrets are stored as redacting `SecretString` values. Effective-config / doctor / support output shows **presence only** (`***`), never plaintext.

## Config file

Resolved via the `directories` crate (app name `aurum`):

| Platform | Typical path |
|----------|----------------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/aurum/config.toml` |
| Linux | `~/.config/aurum/config.toml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\aurum\config.toml` |

### Canonical schema

```toml
[stt]
provider = "local"          # local | openrouter | openai | xai
model = "base"
language = "auto"
# output = "txt"            # txt | srt | json

[tts]
provider = "local"          # local | openrouter | openai | elevenlabs | xai
model = "kitten-nano-int8"
voice = "Luna"
language = "en"
speaking_rate = 1.0
max_chars = 5000
timeout_ms = 120000
# Optional local pack override (directory with aurum-tts-manifest.json — not a bare .onnx)
# pack_dir = "/path/to/pack"
# allow_unverified = false

# Optional custom catalogue entries (JOE-1620). Never shadow built-in ids.
# [[tts.custom_models]]
# id = "my-tone"
# adapter = "fake-sine-v1"
# pack_dir = "/path/to/pack"
# trust = "verified"   # verified | local_unverified (never builtin)
# license = "CC0"

[cleanup]
style = "raw"              # raw | clean | bullets | professional | summary
provider = "rules"         # rules | openrouter
# openrouter_model = "google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite"

# Named provider options + optional file secrets (prefer env vars for keys).
# Unknown [providers.*] keys fail closed.

# [providers.openrouter]
# stt_mode = "auto"          # auto | chat | transcriptions
# model = "google/gemini-2.5-flash"
# base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
# allow_custom_endpoint = false
# use_system_proxy = false

# [providers.openai]
# base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"

# [providers.elevenlabs]
# [providers.xai]

# An optional reviewed deployment catalogue. It can only narrow the built-in
# catalogue: an `enabled = false` record disables a built-in STT model (by
# canonical id or alias), and `[defaults.stt].global` picks the default from
# the remaining `supported` records (never experimental). Records that add or
# replace a model, and TTS records, are rejected for now.
# The path is explicit: Aurum never discovers, fetches, or falls back from it.
# A relative path resolves against this config file's directory (not the cwd).
# [catalogue]
# path = "/absolute/path/to/model-catalogue.toml"
```

Only canonical sections are accepted: `[stt]`, `[cleanup]`, `[tts]`, `[providers.*]`, `[catalogue]`.
Unknown top-level sections (including old `[default]` / `[openrouter]`) fail closed.

A catalogue can only set a single global default per direction, and that
default must be a local `supported` record. Experimental and explicit-only
records (such as the Portuguese specialists) are reachable through an explicit
`[stt].model` / `--model` only; `language` never selects a model. The
diagnostic catalogue digest covers the effective records and defaults, not the
deployment file location, so relocating an unchanged catalogue keeps the same
digest.

#### Deployment catalogue trust model

`[catalogue].path` is a **trusted, operator-owned input**: it decides which
local speech-to-text models this installation may use.

- **Narrowing only.** A deployment catalogue can disable built-in STT models
  and choose the default STT model. A disabled model is rejected however it
  is requested: `--model`, `[stt].model`, `--profile`, `aurum batch`,
  `aurum converse`, or `aurum cache repair`. Model downloads, cache pins and
  TTS selection still come from the built-in catalogue, so a deployment record
  that adds or replaces a model, or any TTS record, fails closed. Supporting
  those records is tracked in
  [the deployment records issue](https://github.com/joe-broadhead/aurum/issues/146).
- **Path resolution.** A relative path resolves against the directory of the
  config file that names it. It never resolves against the process working
  directory, and it is an error when no config file is in use. An absolute
  path is recommended.
- **File policy.** The target must be a regular file of at most 1 MiB. A
  symlink is refused, not followed. Aurum reads the file once at startup and
  fails closed on any read, size, schema, or validation error. There is no
  environment-variable, discovery, or built-in fallback.
- **Directory scope.** Only the final path component is checked for a
  symlink; parent directories are followed. On Unix, Aurum also checks that
  the opened file is the one it inspected (same device and inode); Windows
  has no such check. Keep the catalogue in a directory that only the operator
  can write to.

The embedded catalogue is held to a stricter rule. Its URLs may only use the
reviewed hosts (`huggingface.co`, plus GitHub release assets), and every
Hugging Face URL must name an immutable revision.

### `local_only`

When `local_only` is set on the runtime/validated config (CLI offline flag and library builders), validation rejects a remote STT or TTS provider **before** encoding, upload, or request construction.

## Safety limits

| Limit | Default |
|-------|---------|
| Max duration (STT) | ~2.25 hours |
| Max decoded PCM (STT) | ~500 MB (enforced during decode) |
| Max remote upload (STT) | ~24 MB compressed |
| Max TTS characters | 5000 (`[tts].max_chars`) |
| TTS timeout | 120000 ms (`[tts].timeout_ms`) |
| TTS speaking rate | 1.0, allowed range `0.5..=2.0` (CLI clamps the same) |

Whisper special tokens such as `[BLANK_AUDIO]` are stripped. Segment timestamps
are clamped to audio duration.
